    "In this lab, you will work in teams to use your Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) implementation from Lab 4 in practice. We have set up obstacles in the drone cages (note that the obstacles are in different positions for each of the 3 netted areas). You will measure the positions of the obstacles, field, and starting/end locations, and use the RRT code to find a trajectory through the space. There are measuring tapes in the labs that you can use to make the measurements. We provide you the code to run the drone through a sequence of setpoints (in x,y) provided to it. You will be graded on your ability to autonomously navigate the drone from the starting position to the end goal location. Make sure that your video includes your drone landing within the end position. \n",
